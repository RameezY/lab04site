                    We all love animals... Well, maybe some do. I personally enjoy keeping them as pets and eating them.
                    However, this site is not about food, recipes, or how to teach your hamster to do a silly trick.
                    This site aims to introduce some other uncommon animals from certain species you're very familiar
                    with, such as the ape and lizard species.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many, many years ago, like a really long time ago, some people were like, "Yo, these animals right
                    here... Can we just pet them on the days we don't feel like killing them?" Little Billy thought it
                    was a good idea, he told his friends about this, and this idea of owning pets spread like wildfire.
                    Who thought that someday a snake could be a pet? Well, here we are today, where even a snake is a
                    pet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While you may have heard of basic animals such as a dog or cat, have you, however, heard of other
                    animals such as the loch ness sea monster or the bigfoot? This right here is your chance to learn
                    about them and donate to keep a loch ness sea monster or bigfoot warm during the winter.

                    you to
                    donate to such animals that not even I can confirm are real, that's on you.
