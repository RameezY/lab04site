        The loch ness sea monster is a giant lizard... Or fish?  Who cares? Anyways, this thing likes to float around in Scottland or wherever the loch ness lake is.  It occasionally does tricks like Free Willy, the killer whale, where it jumps out of the lake and smiles stupidly so people can toss it some fries.  For some odd and unknown reason, this fish lizard thing does not pop out of the lake due to the 5G signals from smartphones.  Thus, to encounter this unicorn-like animal, Scottland has enforced a flip-phone only policy when swimming in that lake.
